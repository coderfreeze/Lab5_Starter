1) No, you would not unit test the messaging feature. A messaging feature involves many different  
components to make sure the message sends properly. Testing it unit by unit does not fully test if the full message feature works properly.   
  

2) Yes, you would use a unit test to check if the max length feature works properly. We would unit test this because   
it is a simple check on a message before it sends. It does not involve many different pieces of code to interact with each other such as networking and recipient check.
